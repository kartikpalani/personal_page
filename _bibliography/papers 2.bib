  abstract={Most visions of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) distribute massive numbers of devices throughout physical infrastructure. In most visions, these devices need to talk to each other. For this to work, the devices need to be able to authenticate each other. Presenting design issues and empirical results, this paper explores the cryptographic infrastructure necessary to capture this identity ontology.},
