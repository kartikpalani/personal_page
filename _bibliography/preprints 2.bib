  title={Optimal Monitoring Strategies for Critical Infrastructure
Networks},
  author={Palani, Kartik and Nicol, David},
  abstract={Given a choice among multiple security solutions and multi-
ple locations to deploy them, what strategy best protects the
network? What metric is used to compare different securing
strategies? What constraints make it harder/easier to secure
critical infrastructure networks? This paper explores these
questions and formalizes the network monitoring strategy
problem for critical infrastructure networks. It also presents
a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for discovering a
near-optimal network monitoring strategy.},

  title={Scalable Identity and Key Management for Publish-Subscribe Protocols in the Internet-of-Things},
  author={Anantharaman, Prashant, Palani, Kartik and Smith, Sean},
  abstract={Publish-Subscribe protocols such as the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol are considered scalable, lightweight, and one-size-fits-all solutions for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) networking. MQTT has been widely adopted in the Industrial IoT to automate distributed power grid equipment such as smart meters and sensors. Such protocols are being adopted rapidly, without much attention being paid to security. Although these protocols support client-side TLS certificates, operators often do not enable these features, fearing performance and availability issues. Moreover, managing these certificates would be yet another challenging problem.},
