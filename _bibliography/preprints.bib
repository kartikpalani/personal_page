  title={Optimal Monitoring Strategies for Critical Infrastructure
Networks},
  author={Palani, Kartik and Nicol, David},
  abstract={Given a choice among multiple security solutions and multi-
ple locations to deploy them, what strategy best protects the
network? What metric is used to compare different securing
strategies? What constraints make it harder/easier to secure
critical infrastructure networks? This paper explores these
questions and formalizes the network monitoring strategy
problem for critical infrastructure networks. It also presents
a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for discovering a
near-optimal network monitoring strategy.},
